Let a magnet and a key be held horizontally near one of its poles, or
near its lower edge. Then if another piece of iron, such as a small
nail, be applied to the other end of the key, the nail will hang
from the key, and will continue to do so while the magnet is slowly
withdrawn; but when it has been removed beyond a certain distance, the
nail will drop from the key, because the magnetism induced in the key
becomes at that distance too weak to support the weight of the nail.
That this is the real cause of its falling off may be proved by taking
a still lighter fragment of iron, such as a piece of very slender wire,
and applying it to the key. The magnetism of the key will still be
sufficiently strong to support the wire, though it cannot the nail,
and it will continue to support it even when the magnet is yet further
removed; at length, however, it drops off.
